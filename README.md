# Gawk

Gawk (verb): stare openly and stupidly.

## History

Back in 2014, when I was a novice programmer, I used to pirate a digital version of a magazine called WebDesigner. Each issues of the magazine would have couple of tutorials on web technologies. There was this one tutorial that caught my eye and is still stucked to me till this day.

It was building a starting contest game with nodejs and trackingjs. Nodejs was THE technology back then and the tutorial was mainly trying to emphasize on its realtime features.

Fast forward to 2019, I took the challenge to build it.

## What is Gawk?
